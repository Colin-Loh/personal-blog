<p>
  My journey as a Platform Engineer within the last couple of years was not all smooth sailing. Being diagnosed with ADHD have left me struggling with sustaining attention and often led me being distracted and forgetful - this is just the tip of the iceberg.
  I can go on about all my other problems but I will refrain myself in this blog post. This blog post is about me embracing the cloud journey with my first challenge: #100DaysofCloud specifically Azure! 
  <br>
  <br>
  For the next 100 days, I will commit at least an hour each day to explore the depth of Azure and expanding my knowledge for my own personal growth. 
  This challenge will not only allow me to gain hands on knowledge with Azure cloud but also provide me the opportunity to create self pet projects and overcome my commitment issues. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout this journey, I will be documenting my progress, insights, and challenges through regular blog posts and social media updates specifically on Twitter.
  By openly sharing my experiences, I hope to connect with others in the cloud community who may be facing similar obstacles or looking for inspiration to take on their own learning challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have chosen Azure as my focus area because of its growing prominence in the industry and its wide range of services and solutions. 
  Azure offers a diverse ecosystem that caters to various business needs, and by becoming proficient in Azure, I aim to position myself as a valuable asset in the cloud computing field.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead during these 100 days. I anticipate encountering roadblocks and facing moments of self-doubt, but I am determined to push through and emerge as a more knowledgeable and confident cloud engineer.
  I hope you will find my blog useful enough that it can help you with your own projects or your own cloud journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  You can follow me on my journey via my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Loh/100DaysOfAzure"> here.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  Note that I will not write a blog post of every #100DayofAzure learnings but I will be ocassionally updating my blog with learnings that I find intersting and challenging.
